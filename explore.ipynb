What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links?Then we\\'d never have to write anything to run on users\\' computers.We could generate the sites on the same server we\\'d serve them from.Users wouldn\\'t need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at the time it wasn\\'t clear that it was even possible.To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser.A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n') score=0.7478900875496476\n"
